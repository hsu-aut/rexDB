A web application powered by an ontology that can be used to create, display and maintain researcher expertise (e.g. skills, projects, publications).

This project is based on [this Angular-Nest-Admin-Template](https://github.com/aljoshakoecher/angular-nest-webapp-template). Check out the template's documentation for the basics.


# Development setup

It's best to open two terminals. Use one to run the backend and the other one for the frontend.

* To run the backend, open a terminal inside the backend directory and run `npm run start:dev`. The backend will run on port 3000.
* To run the frontend, open a terminal inside the frontend directory and run `npm run start:dev`. The frontend will run on a local angular development server. Your browser shoould be automatically opend, if not go to http://localhost:4200/ (Note that there is no login. You can just click "login" with or without any credentials)
